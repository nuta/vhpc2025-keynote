# What I'm going to talk about

- ‚ùå Writing a hypervisor from scratch in 45 minutes

- ‚ùå Being able to write a hypervisor from scratch

- ‚úÖ Rediscover the not-so-obvious perspective on virtualization: **virtualization are not only about implementing fast virtual machines!**

Intel VT-x/AMD-V/Arm VHE/RISC-V H are ...

# hardware-assisted `try-catch` (with continuation)

---
# Try-catch pattern

```ts
try {
    emoji = readFile("emoji.txt");
} catch (error) {
    panic(`failed to read a file: ${error}`);
}
```

- The program keeps running until it encounters an exception.
  - i.e. `catch` is called only when the program needs a help.
- You can't resume the program from the point of failure.
  - Retry from the beginning or abort the program.

---
# Try-catch pattern + continuation

Let's assume that we have a `resume` callback:

```ts
try {
    emoji = readFile("emoji.txt");
} catch (error, resume) {
    if (error instanceof FileNotFoundError) {
        resume("üçé");
    }

    panic(`failed to read a file: ${error}`);
}
```
