Intel VT-x/AMD-V/Arm VHE/RISC-V H are ...

# hardware-assisted `try-catch` (with continuation)

---

# Try-catch pattern

```ts
try {
    emoji = readFile("emoji.txt");
} catch (error) {
    panic(`failed to read a file: ${error}`);
}
```

- The program keeps running until it encounters an exception.
  - i.e. `catch` is called only when the program needs a help.
- You can't resume the program from the point of failure.
  - Retry from the beginning or abort the program.

---

# Try-catch pattern + continuation

Let's assume that we have a `resume` callback:

```ts
try {
    emoji = readFile("emoji.txt");
} catch (error, resume) {
    if (error instanceof FileNotFoundError) {
        resume("üçé");
    }

    panic(`failed to read a file: ${error}`);
}
```

# Virtulization is not only about virtual machines

- Interface matters.
- Consider (hardware-assited) hypervisors as JavaScript interpreters.
  - More application-specific interfaces.
    - Reducing "semantic gap", less overheads, and offloading to stuff to hypervisor. Like TLS.
  - How do you interact with JavaScript world? Shared memory, queues, or calling host functions like PIO (`outb`/`inb`)?
- Do we really need virtio?
  - You can implement a hypervisor on top of a microkernel.
- If you see like this, don't Hyperlight, gVisor look familar to you?
