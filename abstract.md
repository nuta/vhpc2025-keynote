# Abstract

Hardware-assisted virtualization technologies like Intel VT and AMD SVM have long been viewed solely as mechanisms for running virtual machines. This talk challenges the preconception - it's actually a hardware-assisted try-catch mechanism, where the hypervisor effectively behaves a a "catch" block for VM exits.

Through this metaphor, we will revisit the virtualization from scratch, explore recent virtualization-based applications, rethink what hardware-assisted virtualization is, and brainstorm how we could do in the near future.
